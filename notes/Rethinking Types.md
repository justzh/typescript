## Nominal Reified Type Systems (or reified, nominal type system)

## Types as Sets

It's easy to think of a one-to-one correspondence between runtime types and their compile-time declarations.

In TypeScript, every type is just a set.

TypeScript provides a number of mechanisms to work with types in a set-theoretic way, and you'll find them more intuitive if you think of types as sets!
